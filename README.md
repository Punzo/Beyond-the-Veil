# Narrative-Role-Play-Games

## Disclaimer

The set rules int this repository are heavily inspired by [Elish](https://www.elish.it/it/cose-elish), _Vampire: The Masquerade_, and the works of _H.P. Lovecraft_, among other sources. The intent is not to create an entirely new system but to merge various mechanics into a **simple, flexible ruleset where narration is the primary focus**.

This is not a comprehensive game manual, but rather a pamphlet that provides 
the foundational rules you can use to create your own campaign. 
I have used this guide to master several campaigns over the last two decades, 
and friends and fellow gamers have often asked me to share it online. So, here it is ðŸ˜ƒ

Here, I present a [**Lovecraftian-flavored adaptation**](Rules_Lovecraft.md), designed for cosmic horror, investigation, and survival against the unknown.

Due to the **flexible nature of the rules**, the rules can be easily adapted to **any setting**. Whether used for fantasy, science fiction, cyberpunk, or historical campaigns, the systemâ€™s core philosophy remains the same: **the story is more important than the rules**. Mechanics exist to **enhance the narrative**, not restrict it, allowing for immersive, cinematic, and dynamic storytelling.
