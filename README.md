# Narrative-Role-Play-Games


## Disclaimer
The set rules int this repository are heavily inspired by [Elish](https://www.elish.it/it/cose-elish), *Vampire: The Masquerade*, and the works of *H.P. Lovecraft*, among other sources. The intent is not to create an entirely new system but to merge various mechanics into a **simple, flexible ruleset where narration is the primary focus**.

This system has been developed and refined over **more than 20 years**, adapted to a variety of settings, including *Shadowrun*, *Forgotten Realms*, and many others. Here, we present a **Lovecraftian-flavored adaptation**, designed for cosmic horror, investigation, and survival against the unknown.

Due to the **flexible nature of the rules**, the rules can be easily adapted to **any setting**. Whether used for fantasy, science fiction, cyberpunk, or historical campaigns, the systemâ€™s core philosophy remains the same: **the story is more important than the rules**. Mechanics exist to **enhance the narrative**, not restrict it, allowing for immersive, cinematic, and dynamic storytelling.
